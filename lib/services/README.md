# Services

This folder will hold all your app's service files. Services are where our business/domain logic exists â€” meaning that all the behaviors and features that make our app unique will exist within a service. 

Services are not responsible for talking to the database, and they are not responsible for handling incoming input. They are responsible for solving real problems

Some examples of services:

* Hash a user password before saving it to the database via a `User` model
* Send an email using Amazon SES
* Send a text message to someone when a new order is made
* Upload files to an S3 bucket
* Fetch info from a web API to fill in data
* Use the tensorflow toxicity model to reject toxic text
